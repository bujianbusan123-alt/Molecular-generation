Artificial Intelligence-Assisted Electrolyte Design to Improve Li<sup>+</sup> Diffusion
## Introduction
The problem of electrolyte freezing and power loss on lithium batteries under low-temperature conditions requires immediate attention, especially applications to high altitude, high latitude regions and aerospace have been limited. Enhancing the Li<sup>+</sup> diffusion coefficient represents a crucial direction for improvement. However, improving Li<sup>+</sup> diffusion coefficient in existed electrolytes has proven to be challenging, exploring new solvents or additives in electrolyte may have great potential. In this study, we present a novel strategy that utilizes advanced techniques to design and find five novel molecules as additives with high Li<sup>+</sup> diffusion coefficient. Our methodology involves two rounds of Molecular generation (MG) and Molecular dynamics (MD), and three rounds of Machine learning (ML), resulting in the highest Li<sup>+</sup> diffusion coefficient of the generated additive being 3.96 times that of the benchmark system (1.72Ã—10<sup>-11</sup> m/s<sup>2</sup>). These findings are of great significance in improving Li<sup>+</sup> diffusion coefficient in practical applications and addressing this persistent issue. Furthermore, these strategies and results provide valuable insights for further investigation into other challenges of lithium batteries.
